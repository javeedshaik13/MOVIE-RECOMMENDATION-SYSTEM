# MOVIE-RECOMMENDATION-SYSTEM
This project is a Movie Recommendation System built using Machine Learning concepts, specifically Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Content-Based Filtering. It recommends movies based on the textual similarity of movie metadata (like overview, genres, tagline, cast, and crew).
